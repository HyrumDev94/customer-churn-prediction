# customer-churn-prediction

This project predicts which telecom clients are likely to churn (cancel their service) using machine learning models.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to help the telecom operator **Interconnect** identify at-risk customers and take proactive retention actions.  
By predicting churn, the company can target clients with promotional offers, reducing revenue loss.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest  
- **Metrics:** AUC-ROC, Accuracy

## Results
- Achieved an AUC-ROC score of **0.89**, indicating a strong predictive model.  
- Identified key features driving churn (e.g., contract type, monthly charges, service tenure).  
- Provided actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies.
